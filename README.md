# The Vienna Vulkan Engine
A Vulkan based render engine

Instructions (Windows 10):
Clone the project, open the .sln file, compile, run.
For Windows 10, all dependencies (including the Vulkan SDK) are in the external directory.
The project will be updated regularly, so it makes sense to download the source files once in a while, or clone the whole project.
Make sure to keep your main.cpp or other files that you created.
