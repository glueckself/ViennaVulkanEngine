# The Vienna Vulkan Engine (VVE)
The Vienna Vulkan Engine (VVVE) is a Vulkan based render engine meant for learning and teaching the Vulkan API. It is open source under the MIT license. The VVE has been started as basis for game based courses at the Faculty of Computer Science of the University of Vienna, held by Prof. Helmut Hlavacs.

VVE's main contributor is Prof. Helmut Hlavacs (http://entertain.univie.ac.at/~hlavacs/). However, VVE will be heavily involved in the aforementioned courses, and other courses as well, and many students are already working on VVE extensions, porting, debugging etc.

VVE features are:
- 100% Vulkan, C++20
- Windowing through GLFW, other systems are possible.
- Multiplatform (almost) out of the box: Win 10, Linux, MacOS (using MoltenVK).
